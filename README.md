# ArmaCMDLineGen
Generates a modlist for use in the Arma 3 Server Commandline


## IMPORTANT
Doesn't support CDLCs yet simply because I haven't gotten around to adding that

I will also be giving it a GUI very soon because atm it sucks to use


## How to use
*Well first download the thing,*

then drag your modslist.html into the 'input' folder and boom.
